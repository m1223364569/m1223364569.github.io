## About the start of something new

![avatar](D:\南京大学\课件\管理学研究工具\w14.png)

Living in my own world

Didn’t understand

That anything can happen

When you take a chance



I never believed in

What I couldn't see

I never opened my heart

To all the possibilities



I know， that something has changed

Never felt this way

And right here tonight

This could be the start of something new

It feels so right ，to be here with you
