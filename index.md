## About the start of something new

![avatar](w14.png)

Living in my own world

Didnâ€™t understand

That anything can happen

When you take a chance



I never believed in

What I couldn't see

I never opened my heart

To all the possibilities



I know that something has changed

Never felt this way

And right here tonight

This could be the start of something new

It feels so right  to be here with you
